Compose Keys
============

"Compose Keys" mimics the functionality of the "Compose" key on Linux computers, and allows you to type accented letters and special symbols using a modifier key followed by 2-letter combinations.

Installation
------------

Copy the "compose-keys" folder to somewhere on your computer, then double-click the "compose.exe" file to start the program.  You can of course create a shortcut to this file if you need to.

How To Use
----------

Press and **release** the 'modifier' key¹, then type any of the 2-letter sequences listed below to obtain the accent or symbol you need.

	[¹ by default "Right Alt" key; this can be changed in the configuration file]

Example:

To obtain [ á ] you would press [ Right-Alt ] then [ ' ] then [ a ].  The order is important!

	- Generally for accented letters the sequence is: modifier => accent => letter
	- For symbols it varies according to the list below.  The 2 characters chosen are usually quite logical and easy to learn.

NOTE: for those who are interested, this list is based wholly on the current Linux compose key guidelines.

Settings
--------

Using the tray icon menu (right click) you can access this help file, and the configuration file, where the following can be changed:

1. SoundOnReset : plays a small blip sound to tell you that the program has loaded, or that the modifier key has been reset (by pressing it twice)
2. ModifierKey : which key should be used as a modifier, e.g. CapsLock, RAlt, LAlt, RControl, LControl, RShift, LShift, etc...
